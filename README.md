Math 300: Evolution of Mathematics

I'm doing all my course structure development and slide notes within a single orgmode file. In order to replicate/use thing, you'd need:

Emacs with `org-mode`, `org-ref`, and `org-re-reveal`, and `reveal.js`.

It also relies on an old version of reveal.js; my version is at least two years old and when I tried the latest (5/27/20) git revision of reveal.js, it didn't work. I don't have time to solve that problem now. Maybe another time.

I'll be updating this frequently to resolve all the TODOs in the org file. TODO will be removed when the section has content.
