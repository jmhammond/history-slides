This, the first volume of the two-volume set, takes readers from the beginning of counting in prehistory to 1600 and the threshold of the discovery of calculus. It is notable for the extensive engagement with original—primary and secondary—source material. The coverage is worldwide, and embraces developments, including education, in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, India, the Islamic world and Europe. The emphasis on astronomy and its historical relationship to mathematics is new, and the presentation of every topic is informed by the most recent scholarship in the field. The two-volume set was designed as a textbook for the authors'acclaimed year-long course at the Open University. It is, in addition to being an innovative and insightful textbook, an invaluable resource for students and scholars of the history of mathematics. The authors, each among the most distinguish},

This is well over a millennium before Hipparchus is said to have fathered the subject with his ‘table of chords’. The main piece of evidence comes from the most famous of Old Babylonian tablets: Plimpton 322, which we interpret in the context of the Old Babylonian approach to triangles and their preference for numerical accuracy. By examining the evidence with this mindset, and comparing Plimpton 322 with Madhava's table of sines, we demonstrate that Plimpton 322 is a powerful, exact ratio-based trigonometric table.},

    Abstract = {The trigonometric functions entered “analysis” when Isaac Newton derived the power series for the sine in his De Analysi of 1669. On the other hand, no textbook until 1748 dealt with the calculus of these functions. That is, in none of the dozen or so calculus texts written in England and the continent during the first half of the 18th century was there a treatment of the derivative and integral of the sine or cosine or any discussion of the periodicity or addition properties of these functions. This contrasts sharply with what occurred in the case of the exponential and logarithmic functions. We attempt here to explain why the trigonometric functions did not enter calculus until about 1739. In that year, however, Leonhard Euler invented this calculus. He was led to this invention by the need for the trigonometric functions as solutions of linear differential equations. In addition, his discovery of a general method for solving linear differential equations with constant coefficients },

I show that the Popular View of it as some sort of trigonometric table cannot be correct, given what is now known of the concept of angle in the Old Babylonian period. Neither is the equally widespread theory of generating functions likely to be correct, I provide supporting evidence in a strong theoretical framework, for an alternative interpretation, first published half a century ago in a different guise. I recast it using regular reciprocal pairs, Hoyrup's analysis of contemporaneous "naive geometry," and a new reading of the table's headings.

abstract = {Mathematics Elsewhere is a fascinating and important contribution to a global view of mathematics. Presenting mathematical ideas of peoples from a variety of small-scale and traditional cultures, it humanizes our view of mathematics and expands our conception of what is mathematical. Through engaging examples of how particular societies structure time, reach decisions about the future, make models and maps, systematize relationships, and create intriguing figures, Marcia Ascher demonstrates that traditional cultures have mathematical ideas that are far more substantial and sophisticated than is generally acknowledged. Malagasy divination rituals, for example, rely on complex algebraic algorithms. And some cultures use calendars far more abstract and elegant than our own. Ascher also shows that certain concepts assumed to be universal--that time is a single progression, for instance, or that equality is a static relationship--are not. The Basque notion of equivalence, for example, is a dynamic and temporal one not adequately captured by the familiar equal sign. Other ideas taken to be the exclusive province of professionally trained Western mathematicians are, in fact, shared by people in many societies. The ideas discussed come from geographically varied cultures, including the Borana and Malagasy of Africa, the Tongans and Marshall Islanders of Oceania, the Tamil of South India, the Basques of Western Europe, and the Balinese and Kodi of Indonesia. This book belongs on the shelves of mathematicians, math students, and math educators, and in the hands of anyone interested in traditional societies or how people think. Illustrating how mathematical ideas play a vital role in diverse human endeavors from navigation to social interaction to religion, it offers--through the vehicle of mathematics--unique cultural encounters to any reader.},

In addition, the book features carefully designed problems that guide readers to a fuller understanding of the relevant mathematics and its social and historical context. Chapter-end exercises, numerous photographs, and a listing of related websites are also included for readers who wish to pursue a specialized topic in more depth. Additional features of The History of Mathematics, Third Edition include:Material arranged in a chronological and cultural contextSpecific parts of the history of mathematics presented as individual lessonsNew and revised exercises ranging between technical, factual, and integrativeIndividual PowerPoint presentations for each chapter and a bank of homework and test questions (in addition to the exercises in the book)An emphasis on geography, culture, and mathematicsIn addition to being an ideal coursebook for undergraduate students, the book also serves as a fascinating reference for mathematically inclined individuals who are interested in learning about the history of mathematics.},

What was its author's intended meaning? How did it reach its present form? Is it original or a translation? Why is it important today? Wardhaugh teaches readers to think about what the original text might have looked like, to consider where and when it was written, and to formulate questions of their own. Readers pick up new skills with each chapter, and gain the confidence and analytical sophistication needed to tackle virtually any text in the history of mathematics.Introduces readers to the methods of textual analysis used by historians Uses actual source material as examples Features boxed summaries, discussion questions, and suggestions for further reading Supplements all major sourcebooks in mathematics history Designed for easy reference Ideal for students and teachers},
