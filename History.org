   - The papyrus contains math:
     - division tables,
     - problems of area and volume,
     - methods for solving various types of problems and equations.
   - Purchased in 1858 by Alexander Henry Rhind.
   - Original likely 18 feet by 13 inches
   - Rhind's fragment partial;

   Quote from Burton's History of Mathematics cite:Burton2011

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The Rhind Papyrus starts with a bold premise. Its content has to do
   with ‚Äúa thorough study of all things, insight into all that exists,
   knowledge of all obscure secrets.‚Äù It soon becomes apparent that we
   are dealing with a practical handbook of mathematical exercises, and
   the only ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù are how to multiply and divide.

   -  How do you divide 9 loaves of bread between 10 men?
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      -  Our way: 9 √∑ 10 = 9/10 of a loaf per man

museum goes as follows:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  4 is the length and 5 the diagonal. What is the breadth ? Its size is
  not known. 4 times 4 is 16. 5 times 5 is 25. You take 16 from 25 and
  there remains 9. What times what shall I take in order to get 9 ? 3
  times 3 is 9. 3 is the breadth.
#+END_QUOTE
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      -  9 √∑ 10 = 2/3 + 1/5 +1/30

-  A /Pythagorean triple/ is a set of three numbers which satisfy the
   Pythagorean theorem.
-  A /primitive Pythagorean triple/ is a triple in which all three
   numbers have no common factors other than one.

**** Seemingly unrelated fact:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  A general fact is that all primitive Pythagorean triples, $a, b, c$
   are given by the expression:
   $a = 2uv, \hspace{2em} b = u^2 - v^2 , \hspace{2em} c = u^2 + v^2$

-  where:
-  $u$ and $v$ have no common factors other than 1,
-  one or the other is even while the other is odd, and
-  $u > v$

   -  After we talk about Euclid, we might come back to this. It's

-  Cross-multiply guesses and errors

   -  $6\cdot 10 = 60, 30 \cdot 10 = 300$

-  Take the difference (if same sign) or the sum (if different)

   -  $300 ‚Äì 60 = 240$

  Cube one-third the coefficient of $x$; add to it the square of one-half the constant of the equation; and take the square root of the whole. You will duplicate [repeat] this, and to one of the two you add one-half the number you have already squared and from the other you subtract one-half the same...

-  This is /casus irreducibilis/

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Cube $2 + \sqrt{-1}$.
   -  $(2 + \sqrt{-1})^3 = 8 + 12\sqrt{-1} - 6 - \sqrt{-1}$

   -  $= 2 + \sqrt{-121}$

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  So $\sqrt[3]{2 + \sqrt{-121}} = 2 + \sqrt{-1}$
-  Similarly, $\sqrt[3]{-2 + \sqrt{-121}} = -2 + \sqrt{-1}$
-  Coming back to Cardano's solution to $x^3- 15x = 4$
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  $x=\sqrt[3]{2+\sqrt{-121}} - \sqrt[3]{-2+\sqrt{-121}}$
   -  $x=(2+\sqrt{-1}) - (-2 + \sqrt{-1})$
   -  $x=4$

General idea:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

-  Depress it using the substitution $y=x-\frac{b}{4a}$, giving: $$y^4 + my^2 + ny = p$$
-  Then cleverly introduce substitutions to turn it into a cubic.
   -  We can solve every cubic using Cardano's method.

  Let it be required to divide 16 into two squares. And let the first

  $(ax-4)^2$, a being any integer and 4 the root of 16; for example, let
  the side be $2x-4$, and the square itself $4x^2 + 16 - 16x$. Then
  $4x^2 + 16 - 16x = 16 - x^2$. Add to both sides the negative terms and
  take like from like. Then $5x^2 = 16x$, and $x=16/5$. One number will
  therefore be 256/25, the other 144/25, and their sum is 400/25 or 16,

-  Working in base-60, sexagesimal.
-  Letting the diameter of the circle be 120
-  This makes the radius 60, which is a unit in sexagesimal
-  First, find the chord for $36^\circ$

   -  Using Euclid II.6 (discussed in class in the algebra notes)
   -  He finds the chord is $37;4,55$

- Second, he found the chord for $72^\circ$, being $70; 32, 3$
- Next, the chord for $60^\circ$ is $60$.
- It's worth remembering: $\mbox{crd} \alpha = 2R \sin\dfrac\alpha2$

2. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.
3. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.
4. All right angles are congruent.
5. If two lines are drawn which intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.

**** Does an ant walking on a ball know it's walking on a ball?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- In calc 3, we find the curvature of a sphere is $\dfrac{1}{R^2}$ with $R$ the radius
- the bigger the sphere, the less curved the sphere
- We see a ball is round because we're outside the ball, looking on
- If you're standing on a surface, can you, without leaving it, determine its curvature?
  - positive, negative, zero?

**** Measuring "intrinsic curvature"

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Here, "intrinsic" means a property that can be seen within the object itself
  - not from a higher dimension

- Gauss, as a surveyor; two approaches
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  1. Circles:
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - put a stake in the ground
     - tie a long rope around it.
     - measure out the circumference of a circle centered at your stake.
     - divide the circumference by two times the length of the rope (i.e. diameter)
     - if ratio $= \pi$, it's flat: zero curvature
     - if ratio $\lt \pi$, positive curvature
     - if ratio $\gt \pi$, negative curvature

  #+REVEAL: split
  1. Triangles:
     #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
     - put three stakes on the ground, somewhat far apart
     - tie ropes to each stake
     - measure the angles between each rope.
     - If the sum of the angles $=180^\circ$, it's flat; zero curvature
     - If the sum of the angles $\lt 180^\circ$, it's negative curvature
     - If the sum of the angles $\gt 180^\circ$, it's positive curvature

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

- in 1829, and in Russian
  - replaces the parallel postulate with "more than one line"
  - (independent of Gauss and Bolyai)
- Shows sum of angles in a triangle is always less than two right angles
- ... and gets smaller the larger the triangle

**** Circle equations
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 - This is just a personal note to put them somewhere.
 - In plane geometry, circle formulas are obvious:
   \[ C(r) = 2\pi r \hspace{1em} A(r) = \pi r^2 \]
 - In hyperbolic geometry (constant negative curvature):
   \[ C(r) = 2\pi \sinh(r) \hspace{1em} A(r) = 4\pi\sinh^2\left(\frac{r}{2}\right) \]
 - In elliptic geometry (with constant positive curvature - a sphere of radius $R$):
   \[ C(r) = 2\pi R \sin\left(\frac{r}{R}\right) \hspace{1em} A(r) = 2\pi R^2 \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)\right) \]
