   - Ahmes was an Egyptian scribe, born about 1680 B.C.
   - Wrote the papyrus
   - ... says he copied from earlier work circa 2000 B.C.
   - The papyrus contains math:
     - division tables,
     - problems of area and volume,
     - methods for solving various types of problems and equations.
   - Purchased in 1858 by Alexander Henry Rhind.
   - Original likely 18 feet by 13 inches
   - Rhind's fragment partial;
      - rest found in New York Historical Society

   Quote from Burton's History of Mathematics cite:Burton2011

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The Rhind Papyrus starts with a bold premise. Its content has to do
   with “a thorough study of all things, insight into all that exists,
   knowledge of all obscure secrets.” It soon becomes apparent that we
   are dealing with a practical handbook of mathematical exercises, and
   the only “secrets” are how to multiply and divide.

   -  How do you divide 9 loaves of bread between 10 men?
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      -  Our way: 9 ÷ 10 = 9/10 of a loaf per man
   -  Mathematically, this is fair, but the guy with 10 tenths is probably not too happy!

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  The Egyptian way:
- Example:
A translation of a Babylonian tablet which is preserved in the British
museum goes as follows:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  4 is the length and 5 the diagonal. What is the breadth ? Its size is
  not known. 4 times 4 is 16. 5 times 5 is 25. You take 16 from 25 and
  there remains 9. What times what shall I take in order to get 9 ? 3
  times 3 is 9. 3 is the breadth.
#+END_QUOTE
      #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
      -  9 ÷ 10 = 2/3 + 1/5 +1/30
   -  The nine loaves of bread seem to be more “fairly” distributed this way!

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  A /Pythagorean triple/ is a set of three numbers which satisfy the
   Pythagorean theorem.
-  A /primitive Pythagorean triple/ is a triple in which all three
   numbers have no common factors other than one.

**** Seemingly unrelated fact:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: seemingly-unrelated-fact-1
   :END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  A general fact is that all primitive Pythagorean triples, $a, b, c$
   are given by the expression:
   $a = 2uv, \hspace{2em} b = u^2 - v^2 , \hspace{2em} c = u^2 + v^2$

-  where:
-  $u$ and $v$ have no common factors other than 1,
-  one or the other is even while the other is odd, and
-  $u > v$

-  A /perfect number/ one that equals the sum of its proper divisors.
   -  After we talk about Euclid, we might come back to this. It's
      remarkable!
-  An /abundant number/ is one such that the sum of the proper divisors
   is greater than the number.

   is less than the number.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Diophantus of Alexandria lives around 3rd century AD (probably)
-  He quotes Hypsicles (150BC) and is quoted by Theon of Alexandria
   (350AD)
-  A book by the Bishop of Laodicia dedicated a book to Diophantus
   around 278AD

-  What we know is a puzzle:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Diophantus passed 1/6 of his life in childhood, 1/12 in youth, and 1/7
  more as a bachelor. Five years after his marriage was born a son who
  died 4 years before his father, at 1/2 his father's [final] age

What did he do?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Wrote three works: /Arithmetica/, /On Polygonal Numbers/, and
   /Porisms/.
-  The first we have a lot of (6 of 13 books)
-  Second we have fragments
-  Third is completely lost.

*** /Arithmetica/
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: arithmetica
   :END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  A book on what we now call algebraic number theory
-  Deals with 130 problems and solutions
-  Problems involved 1st and 2nd degree equations (requiring positive
   rational solutions)
-  No general methods, just solving individually (with clever tricks)
-  The Greek contribution to algebra (to be picked up in a couple weeks)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Find two numbers such that their product added to either gives a
  square number.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Find three numbers such that their sum is a square and the sum of any

-  Book II, problem 8: To divide a given square number into two squares.
   As quoted in cite:Katz2003, pg 177:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Let it be required to divide 16 into two squares. And let the first
  square = $x^2$; then the other will be $16-x^2$; it shall be required
  therefore to make $16-x^2=$ a square. I take a square of the form
  $(ax-4)^2$, a being any integer and 4 the root of 16; for example, let
  the side be $2x-4$, and the square itself $4x^2 + 16 - 16x$. Then
  $4x^2 + 16 - 16x = 16 - x^2$. Add to both sides the negative terms and
  take like from like. Then $5x^2 = 16x$, and $x=16/5$. One number will
  therefore be 256/25, the other 144/25, and their sum is 400/25 or 16,
  and each is a square.

Solution to Book II, problem 8 suggests general method:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  To find two numbers $x$ and $y$ so that $x^2 + y^2 = b^2$:
-  Pick $a$ to be any number.
-  Set $y=ax-b$
-  Then $b^2 - x^2 = a^2 x^2 -2abx + b^2$
-  ... $2abx = (a^2+1)x^2$
-  ... $\displaystyle x = \frac{2ab}{a^2+1}$.
-  What about other powers?
# -  (That's a teaser. We'll talk about it when we get to number theory later)
*** Hypatia of Alexandria

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

    Translated the Greek and added his commentary
- 1621 - Bachet de Meziriac
    Published the Greek and Latin together with notes

*** Fermat's Last Theorem(?)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Conjecture: The expression $x^n + y^n = z^n$ has no integer solutions for $n>2$.


*** Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Conjecture: All elliptic curves are modular.
    - Conjectured by Yukata Taniyama and Goro Shimura in 1955.
- (I intended this slide to seem jarring and out of place)



*** Andrew Wiles (1953-present)
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - As a boy (of about 12) read about Fermat's Conjecture
    - ... so he gets his PhD in Mathematics
    - Becomes and still is a Professor of Mathematics at Oxford
    - Worked in a specialized field involving elliptic curves
    - Fermat's Conjecture is a hard problem, don't work on it

*** Fermat's Last Theorem


#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- 1987: "The Epsilon Conjecture"
    The Taniyama-Shimura conjecture implies Fermat's Last Theorem.
- Wiles learns about this result...
- ... and spends the next seven years of his professional life proving one of the most difficult results in modern mathematics.
- Proven. 1993.
- ... an error.
- Patched up (100ish? pages later) 1994.
    Completely correct.
- BBC/Horizon's Documentary on Fermat's Last Theorem. You can find it on YouTube or Vimeo.
