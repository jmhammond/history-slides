* Day 1
** Before class :noexport:
No readings; welcome to class
Reply on Discourse to the About Me post.
** Activities :noexport: :noexport:
** After class :noexport: :noexport:
- Read:
  - Sketch 1
  - Nutshell, pages 5-25
- Do:
  - Sketch 1 questions 1-3
- Draw a grid [[https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1WFRxfpXJwlwzkklCe_3v_Y6ZlBOTymED-OrIbstwywM/edit?usp=sharing][that looks like this or print this out]]
- Find a lot of small things (pennies, dry corn, pebbles, rice). At least 30 of them.

** Course overview
*** Me: Go visit Blackboard
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
1. Show off Blackboard structure,
2. Demo Discourse (we've seen it having posted already, yay!)
3. Talk through the syllabus
   - it's a lot
** A note about course ordering
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Sketches discuss individual concepts at a time
- We'll be visiting many different cultures/countries in many different time periods
- This will mean having to remind yourself of what time you're considering
- ... it's not difficult, just worth noting
- Also, the order of the sketches is out-of-order to the textbook
  it to paint a narrative of my choosing, putting together some interconnected themes.

** Let's do a little class!

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-do-we-see-numbers-in-different-bases
   :END:

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Pick a base $b$, then you can represent any number, $N$, uniquely by:
  $$N = a_n b^n + a_{n-1}b^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 b + a_0$$

  For example, in base 10,
  $$6735 = 6\cdot 10^3 + 7\cdot 10^2 + 3 \cdot 10 + 5$$

- If we want base 2, the number $13 = 1\cdot 2^3 + 1\cdot 2^2 + 1$, we
  write: $$13_{ten} = 1101_{two} = 1101_{2}$$

#+REVEAL: split
- Let's convert into different bases to practice:
  - 782 to base 60
  - 782 to base 20

*** Positional vs. not positional.

   Quote from Burton's History of Mathematics cite:Burton2011

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The Rhind Papyrus starts with a bold premise. Its content has to do
   with ‚Äúa thorough study of all things, insight into all that exists,
   knowledge of all obscure secrets.‚Äù It soon becomes apparent that we
   are dealing with a practical handbook of mathematical exercises, and
   the only ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù are how to multiply and divide.

- 2 + 27 = 29
- Take half the 29 (14;30)
- 14;30 $\times$ 14;30 = 3,30;15

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There is another rule, more noble than the preceding. It is Lodovico Ferrari's, who gave it to me on my request. Through it we have all the solutions for equations of the fourth power.

General idea:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Starting with a general quartic $$ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0$$
-  Depress it using the substitution $y=x-\frac{b}{4a}$, giving: $$y^4 + my^2 + ny = p$$
-  Then cleverly introduce substitutions to turn it into a cubic.
   -  We can solve every cubic using Cardano's method.

  Let us first assume that if we wish to find the approximate root of 13 that this will be 3 with 4 left over. This remainder should be divided by 6 (double the 3 given above) which gives $2/3$. This is the first fraction which is to be added to the 3, making 3 $2/3$ which is the approximate root of 13. Since the square of this number is 13 $4/9$ it is $4/9$ too large, and if one wishes a closer approximation, the 6 which is the double of the 3 should be added to the fraction $2/3$, giving 6 $2/3$ and this number should be divided into the $4$ which is the difference between 13 and 9, ...

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Let us suppose we are required to find the root of 13. The nearest square is 9, which has root 3. I let the approximate root of 13 be 3 plus 1 tanto /unknown/.
-  Its square is 9 plus 6 tanti p. 1 power. We set this equal to 13.
-  Subtracting 9 from either side of the equation we are left with 4 equal to 6 tanti plus one power.
-  Many people have neglected the power and merely set 6 tanti, equal to 4. The tanto then comes to $2/3$.
-  and the approximate value of the root is 3 $2/3$ since it has been set equal to 3 p. 1 tanto.

#+REVEAL: split

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  However, taking the power into account, if the tanto is equal to $2/3$, the power will be $2/3$ of a tanto, which, added to the 6 tanti, will give us 6 and $2/3$ tanti, which are equal to 4.
-  So the tanto will be equal to $3/5$, and since the appropximate is 3 p. 1 tanto it comes to 3 $3/5$.
-  But if the tanto is equal to 3 $3/5$, the power will be $3/5$ of a tanto and we obtain 6 $3/5$ tanti equal to 4 ...

  Let it be required to divide 16 into two squares. And let the first

  $(ax-4)^2$, a being any integer and 4 the root of 16; for example, let
  the side be $2x-4$, and the square itself $4x^2 + 16 - 16x$. Then
  $4x^2 + 16 - 16x = 16 - x^2$. Add to both sides the negative terms and
  take like from like. Then $5x^2 = 16x$, and $x=16/5$. One number will

Do you crochet? You can make a hyperbolic plane!

The pattern is incredibly simple: as long as you consistently increase the same for every row, you'll achieve a hyperbolic surface (constant negative curvature).

I've made several different increase counts. Let's do the simplest version:

1. Chain 20.
2. 4sc, inc.
3. repeat row 2 until it's as big as you want. The finished project will look like coral.

Note on notation: "sc" is single crochet, and when I say "inc" I mean two sc in one stitch.

**** Does an ant walking on a ball know it's walking on a ball?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- In calc 3, we find the curvature of a sphere is $\dfrac{1}{R^2}$ with $R$ the radius
- the bigger the sphere, the less curved the sphere

     - put a stake in the ground
     - tie a long rope around it.
     - measure out the circumference of a circle centered at your stake.
     - divide the circumference by two times the length of the rope (i.e. diameter)
     - if ratio $= \pi$, it's flat: zero curvature
     - if ratio $\lt \pi$, positive curvature
     - if ratio $\gt \pi$, negative curvature

   \[ C(r) = 2\pi r \hspace{1em} A(r) = \pi r^2 \]
 - In hyperbolic geometry (constant negative curvature):
   \[ C(r) = 2\pi \sinh(r) \hspace{1em} A(r) = 4\pi\sinh^2\left(\frac{r}{2}\right) \]
 - In elliptic geometry (with constant positive curvature - a sphere of radius $R$):
   \[ C(r) = 2\pi R \sin\left(\frac{r}{R}\right) \hspace{1em} A(r) = 2\pi R^2 \left(1 - \cos\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)\right) \]

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Math is created by people
- People are flawed
- People knew a lot of things long ago
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - The world is round, Siska.
  - Hydraulics and engineering are things Greeks and Arabs did
    - including steam engines
  - But some things took a long time to come around
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - square roots are okay
    - zero
    - negative numbers aren't scary

**** Three Classical Problems:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: three-classical-problems
   :END:

Using only the tools of the compass and an unmarked straight-edge

-  Trisection of an arbitrary angle
-  Squaring the circle
-  Duplication of the cube

**** Are these theoretically important?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: are-these-theoretically-important
   :END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  No.
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  There were no theorems that depended on their truth.
-  ... but attempts to solve them led to advancements.

**** Can it be done?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: can-it-be-done
   :END:

- Trisection of the angle:
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - For some angles, sure.
  - If I use other tools? Sure.
  - with a compass and straight-edge? No
    - Proved in 1837 by Wantzel
    - Requires "abstract algebra"

#+REVEAL: split
- Duplicating the cube
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - Also no.
  - 1837 (same person - same work)

- Squaring the circle
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
  - No.
    #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Proved in 1882 by Lindemann
    - He showed $\pi$ is transcendental
    - (transcendental numbers can't be constructed. More abstract algebra)

**** The problems led to:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  Studying conic sections

  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  Duplicating the cube (e.g. $x^3 = 2$)
   -  Trisection of angle ($8x^3 - 6x -1 = 0$)

**** Here's an example of a simple angle: $60^\circ$:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: for-my-own-future-sanity-60circ-is-a-nice-angle-but
   :END:

The question:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- "Show that $8x^3 - 6x -1 = 0$ has no rational solution"
- is asking, "can I construct $20^\circ$?"
- $\cos 60^\circ = 1/2$
- $\cos (20^\circ + 20^\circ + 20^\circ) = 1/2$
- $4 \cos^3 (20^\circ) - 3\cos(20^\circ ) = 1/2$
- Let $x=\cos 20^\circ$
- $4x^3 - 3x = 1/2$
- $8x^3 - 6x -1 = 0$
- this has no rational solution. So, no, I can't construct it.

**** The vagueness of the parallel postulate
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Led to a lot of people trying to prove or disprove it
- Big names:
  - Ptolemy, Proclus
  - Omar Khayyam, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi
  - Johann Lambert
    - (Lambert is the one who proved $\pi$ is irrational)
  - Carl Friedrich Gauss, Nokolai Lobachevsky, Janos Bolyai
- Leads to the necessarily geometric tools for Albert Einstein's General Relativity

**** Hilbert's Problems
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hilberts-problems
   :END:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
-  In 1900, David Hilbert posed 23 problems at the International Congress of Mathematicians
-  Various problems, for example,
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   1. The continuum hypothesis (anything between counting numbers and the set of real numbers?)
      # $\aleph_0$ and $\textbf{c}$?)
   2. The Riemann Hypothesis
-  Many solved, from 1900, 1920's, 1930's, 1950's, 1960's 1970's,
   1990's.
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   -  One was too vague, dismissed
   -  4 unresolved
   -  8 partially solved
   -  10 solved
-  Spurred development in many, many areas of math.

**** The Millennium Problems
   :PROPERTIES:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
- Seven problems posed in 2000 by the Clay Mathematics Institute
- Solved (one):
  - Poincare conjecture (solved in 2006 by Grigori Perelman)
    - Won the Fields Medal, but declined it

- 6 Unsolved:
  - The Riemann Hypothesis
  - P vs. NP
  - ...



# ** A computational aside:


# #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
# - Computer circuits are a sequence of 0 and 1's
# - ... but they're tiny, they're electrical
# - ... they can make physical mistakes
# - ... (interference, gamma radiation, ...)
# - How reliably can we trust that a circuit will return the correct answer?
# - Paper from June of this year Hao Huang
